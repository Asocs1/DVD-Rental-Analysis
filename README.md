## DVD Rental Analysis

### Project Overview
This project explores data from the Sakila DVD Rental database. The goal is to analyze various aspects of family movie rentals, using SQL queries to extract insights and build visualizations based on the data. The project answers several key questions about rental patterns and customer behavior.

### Questions and Corresponding Queries

| How are family films distributed across different rental quartiles?       | [Family movies quartile count.sql](https://github.com/Asocs1/DVD-Rental-Analysis/blob/main/Family%20movies%20quartile%20count.sql)   |
| How did the top 10 customers' payments vary by month in 2007?             | [Top customer monthly payments.sql](https://github.com/Asocs1/DVD-Rental-Analysis/blob/main/Top%20customer%20monthly%20payments.sql)  |

### Report and Visualizations
The detailed answers, visualizations, and analysis results for all the questions above are provided in the final report.
Report file: [report-sql.pdf](https://github.com/Asocs1/DVD-Rental-Analysis/blob/main/report-sql.pdf)
The report includes charts and insights generated from the SQL queries.

### Technologies Used
* PostgreSQL: Database management system used to run SQL queries.
* SQL: Language used to query and analyze the data from the DVD Rental database.
* Data Visualization: Visualizations were created using tools like Excel or other charting libraries.

### How to Run the Project
1. Download and set up [the Sakila DVD Rental sample database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) in PostgreSQL.
2. Run the SQL queries provided in the .sql files to extract the data.
3. Use data visualization tools (e.g., Excel, Power BI) to create the charts and graphs based on the query results.
